# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Expense Management application repository that is currently in the initial setup phase.

## Repository Status

This repository has been freshly initialized with:
- A standard Node.js .gitignore configuration
- Basic LICENSE and README files
- No application code has been implemented yet

## Development Setup

As this is a new project, the technology stack and build tooling have not yet been established. When implementing the codebase, typical expense management applications include:
- Backend API for transaction management
- Database for storing expense records
- Frontend for user interaction
- Authentication and user management

## Future Documentation

As the codebase is developed, this file should be updated to include:
- Build and test commands
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Database schema and migrations
- API structure and endpoints
- Development workflow
